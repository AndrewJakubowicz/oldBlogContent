Welcome to my thoughts!


### Who am I?
I'm a software engineering student at Monash University.
I also hold a science degree in "Animal Health and Disease".
I dropped out of a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Course to pursue technology!

**Why would I do that?**

I worked with some professors to create learning resources for the other Vet students.
This allowed me to use my hobby (programming) in a semi-professional environment.
This experience caused me to re-evaluate my life and now here I am.


### My interests
Here is a random list of some things that interest me now:

- Functional Programming
- Rust
- Go
- Python
- Javascript
- Compilers
- Operating Systems
- Games
