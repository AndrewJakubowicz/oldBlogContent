Welcome to my thoughts!


### Who am I?
I'm a software engineering student at Monash University.
I also hold a science degree in "Animal Health and Disease".

**Why would I do that?**

I worked with professors to create learning resources for Vet students.
This allowed me to use my hobby (programming) in a semi-professional environment.
This experience caused me to re-evaluate my life and pushed me to pursue software professionally.


### My interests
Here is a random list of some things that interest me now:

- Functional Programming
- Web Servers
- Go
- Python
- Javascript
- Compilers
- Distributed Computing
- Operating Systems
- Games
